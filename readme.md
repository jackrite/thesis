## Master's thesis (pending publication)

Abstract

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disorder that affects the nervous system. In the long term,
parts of the brain deteriorate causing involuntary movements of the body. Among
the noticeable motor symptoms, the gait of the individual is gradually perturbed over
time. The progression and severity of PD symptoms are currently assessed via the
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoenh & Yahr (HY) scale.
This UPDRS consists of subjective ratings in questionnaires filled by the patient, their
caregivers and the clinician. Since subjective ratings might be subject to inconsistencies,
there is a growing demand to provide quantitative assessments of gait. Gait parameters
extracted from wearable digital devices worn by the PD patient have the potential
to help with the diagnosis, as well as, predict PD progression. The challenge is to
accurately validate the gait parameters as digital biomarkers to detect PD and monitor
its progression.
Instead of performing multiple single statistical analyses per outcome, the latent
time joint mixed effects model (LTJMM) can take into account the correlation among
multiple outcomes simultaneously for modeling multiple long-term trajectories. Two
cohorts of patients (Erlangen and NCERPD) have been analyzed with the LTJMM.
Despite the absence of the HY stage of the patient in the formula of the LTJMM, the
latent time ordering of PD patients reflected the HY progression of the severity of the
patient.
Moreover, linear modeling techniques testing the association of gait parameters with
UPDRS ratings were used in different frameworks. Both the longitudinal analysis
(Erlangen) and the cross-sectional one (NCERPD) revealed that Gait speed, Stride
length, Stride time and Stance time were associated with the clinical score axial score.
These results have important implications for clinicians and PD patients. They could
improve the objective rating accuracy of motor symptoms of PD patients and their
progression.




# Non Line of Sight Imaging, A deep learning approach to 3d point cloud reconstruction
## Master of science project

Goal of the experiment

From the transient, several methods exist to reconstruct the hidden 3d object such as in
the approaches with diffuse mirrors or with the light-cone transform. Instead of
implementing a specific reconstruction algorithm from transient to object, the approach in
this lab was to implement a deep learning approach to reconstruct the 3d hidden object from
transient. However, the TOF transient in NLOS are computationally intensive to process.
In this lab, two reductions in dimensionality of the transient will be applied on the transient,
one based on sinogram method and the other one based on Fermat path. 3 deep learning
process with their respective transient representations are implemented: 3d transient (TOF
transient), transient from fermat path, transient sinogram. A group of 3 students where
each was responsible for a transient representation. These 3 different representations could
then be compared in terms of efficiency and accuracy of 3d reconstruction. This report is
focused mainly on the implementation of the deep learning approach from 3d transient.



# Satiation decreasing effect on brain activation in insula and orbital frontal cortex

## Bachelor's thesis

Abstract

The reward value of food taste is represented in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC). The
primary gustatory cortex is situated in the insula. When an individual is satiated, the
neuronal response of OFC is decreased compared to a fasted condition. The effect
of satiation on the neuronal response of insula is not clearly defined in the literature.
By using a new approach to measure satiation, the decreasing effect of satiation on
brain activity of the OFC and the insula throughout the duration of the experiment
was investigated. 14 fasted healthy participants were scanned with functional
magnetic resonance imaging while receiving chocolate milkshake at random
intervals. The rating value of pleasantness and the blood oxygen level–dependent
(BOLD) signals to the milkshake taste were recorded. The new method uses the
cumulative mass of nutrients ingested during the experiment as the main parameter
of satiation. Results showed no evidence that satiation has a decreasing effect on
the pleasantness value of the milkshake and on BOLD signals in the OFC. Satiation
was associated with a decreasing BOLD signal in the mid-insula. However, there is
no evidence that the new method has reliably measured satiation. Therefore, the
validity of the results is questionable.
